# ðŸŽ® OOP & API Assignment

## ðŸ“Œ **Task Description**
In this assignment, we will apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and work with an **API** by building a website that displays a list of games and allows viewing the details of any selected game.

## ðŸ”¥ **Requirements**
1. **Divide the page into two main sections:**
   - **Games Section**: Displays a list of games.
   - **Details Section**: Shows the details of the selected game.

2. **Functionality:**
   - The **Games Section** is displayed by default.
   - When clicking on a game, its `id` is sent to the **API** to fetch its details.
   - After retrieving the data, the **Games Section** is hidden, and the **Details Section** is displayed with the fetched information.

3. **Using OOP:**
   - Create a **Class for each Section**, where each class handles its specific operations.
   - Create a **UI Class** that includes all **methods** responsible for displaying data on the page.
